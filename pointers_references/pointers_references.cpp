#include <iostream>

/**
 * Pointers store addresses of variables or memory addresses.
 * References are alternative names to existing variables, NOT copies of them.
 *
 * Both references and pointers can be used to change local variables of one function inside another function.
 * Both of them can also be used to avoid copying of big objects when passed as arguments to functions or when returned
 * from functions, to get efficiency gain. Despite the above similarities, here are some differences between
 * references and pointers:
 *
 * 1. A pointer can be declared as void but a reference can never be void
 * 2. References cannot be updated (reference another variable), but pointers can.
 * 3. References cannot be NULL, but pointers can.
 * 4. Members of an object reference can be accessed with the dot operator (â€˜.â€™), unlike pointers where the arrow
 *    operator (->) is needed to access members.
